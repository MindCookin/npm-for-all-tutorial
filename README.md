It is just an example on how the same JS code can be ran independently in server and/or client without any changes. Making the most of both worlds in the same language lets us create extremely performant applications, balancing responsabilities between client and server.

This is usually called _Isomorphic Javascript_, and has some advantages from Single Page Applications and pure client MVC.
