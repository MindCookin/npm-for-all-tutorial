# Browserify

Browserify let you use npm packages into the browser. How? easy, it is just a Common JS (the NodeJS module format) packager, but it injects much of the functionalities of NodeJS into the browser.

Simple, but incredibly powerful.

This branch shows a simple browserify project. Just run `npm install` and `npm run build` to see the magic.

Please check `package.json` for an _indepth_ overview.
