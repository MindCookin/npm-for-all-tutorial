        If you can see this, React is not working right. This is probably because you&apos;re viewing
        this on your file system instead of a web server. Try running
        <pre>
          python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        </pre>
        and going to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>.
